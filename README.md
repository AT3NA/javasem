 5.Describe what a Class represents in Java.
In Java, a class is a fundamental building block and a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes, and each class encapsulates data (attributes or fields) and behaviors (methods or functions) that define the characteristics and actions of the objects created from it. Here are the key components and concepts associated with a class in Java:

1. **Fields/Attributes/Variables:**
   - These are data members that represent the properties or characteristics of the class.
   - Fields define the state of an object and can be of various data types, including primitive types and other classes.

    ```java
    public class MyClass {
        // Fields
        int myField1;
        String myField2;
    }
    ```

2. **Methods/Functions:**
   - These are functions that define the behavior or actions that objects of the class can perform.
   - Methods are responsible for manipulating the state of the object or providing information about the object.

    ```java
    public class MyClass {
        // Fields
        int myField;

        // Methods
        void setMyField(int value) {
            myField = value;
        }

        int getMyField() {
            return myField;
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Constructors:**
   - Constructors are special methods used for initializing objects when they are created.
   - They have the same name as the class and are invoked with the `new` keyword.

    ```java
    public class MyClass {
        // Fields
        int myField;

        // Constructor
        public MyClass(int initialValue) {
            myField = initialValue;
        }
    }
    ```

4. **Access Modifiers:**
   - Java provides access modifiers (e.g., `public`, `private`, `protected`) to control the visibility of fields, methods, and constructors.
   - These modifiers determine which classes can access the members of another class.

    ```java
    public class MyClass {
        // Public field
        public int myField;

        // Private field
        private int myPrivateField;

        // Public method
        public void myMethod() {
            // Method implementation
        }

        // Private method
        private void myPrivateMethod() {
            // Method implementation
        }
    }
    ```

5. **Inheritance:**
   - Classes can inherit properties and behaviors from other classes using the `extends` keyword.
   - Inheritance supports code reuse and promotes the creation of a hierarchy of classes.

    ```java
    public class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
        // Additional fields and methods for the child class
    }
    ```

6. **Encapsulation:**
   - Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (fields) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (a class).
   - Access to the internal details of the class is controlled, often by using access modifiers.

    ```java
    public class MyClass {
        // Private field
        private int myField;

        // Public method for accessing myField
        public int getMyField() {
            return myField;
        }
    }
    ```

7. **Polymorphism:**
   - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.
   - It enables method overloading and overriding, contributing to flexibility and extensibility.

    ```java
    public class Animal {
        void makeSound() {
            System.out.println("Some generic sound");
        }
    }

    public class Dog extends Animal {
        // Overrides the makeSound method
        void makeSound() {
            System.out.println("Woof!");
        }
    }
    ```

These concepts collectively make up the structure and behavior of Java classes, supporting the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP).





### 6. Object in Java:

An object in Java is an instance of a class and represents a real-world entity that possesses both state and behavior. The state is defined by the fields (variables) of the class, and the behavior is defined by the methods (functions) associated with the class. Objects are created from classes using the `new` keyword, encapsulating data and methods that operate on that data.

```java
public class Car {
    // Fields
    String model;
    int year;

    // Method
    void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Engine started for " + model);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of the Car class
        Car myCar = new Car();

        // Setting the state (data) of the object
        myCar.model = "Toyota";
        myCar.year = 2022;

        // Calling a method to exhibit behavior
        myCar.startEngine();
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Engine started for Toyota
```

### 7. Inheritance:

Inheritance in object-oriented programming allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class). The subclass can extend, override, or add new attributes and behaviors.

```java
// Base class
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating");
    }
}

// Derived class inheriting from Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog is barking");
    }

    // Overriding the eat method
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Dog is eating");
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Dog is eating
```

### 8. Encapsulation in Java:

Encapsulation in Java is a concept in object-oriented programming that involves bundling the data (fields) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. Access to the internal details of the class is restricted using access modifiers, hiding the implementation details and providing a well-defined interface for interacting with the object.

```java
public class BankAccount {
    // Private fields
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;

    // Public methods for interaction
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient funds");
        }
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

Output: (No explicit output, as it's demonstrating the concept of encapsulation)

### 9. Polymorphism in Java:

Polymorphism in Java is the ability of a class to take on multiple forms. It can be achieved through method overloading, where a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists, and method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.

```java
// Method Overloading
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

Output: (No explicit output, as it's demonstrating the concept of method overloading)

```java
// Method Overriding
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Some generic sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    // Overrides the makeSound method
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Woof!
```

Polymorphism allows code to be more flexible and extensible, as it enables the use of a common interface to represent objects of different classes.









20.write a program to sort a set of names stored in an array in alphabetical
order.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class NameSorter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Array of names
        String[] names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eva"};

        // Sorting names in alphabetical order
        Arrays.sort(names);

        // Displaying sorted names
        System.out.println("Sorted Names:");
        for (String name : names) {
            System.out.println(name);
        }
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Sorted Names:
Alice
Bob
Charlie
David
Eva
```










### 22. Default Constructor with Non-parameterized Constructor:

In Java, a default constructor is a constructor with no parameters, and it is automatically provided by the compiler if no constructor is explicitly defined in a class. A non-parameterized constructor, on the other hand, is a constructor that takes no parameters but is explicitly defined by the programmer.

Example:

```java
public class MyClass {
    // Default constructor (provided by the compiler)
    public MyClass() {
        System.out.println("Default Constructor");
    }

    // Non-parameterized constructor
    public MyClass(int value) {
        System.out.println("Non-parameterized Constructor with value: " + value);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating objects using different constructors
        MyClass obj1 = new MyClass();            // Default constructor
        MyClass obj2 = new MyClass(10);          // Non-parameterized constructor
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Default Constructor
Non-parameterized Constructor with value: 10
```

### 23. Difference between `==` and `.equals()`:

In Java, `==` is used to compare the reference equality of objects, meaning it checks if two references point to the same memory address. On the other hand, the `.equals()` method is used to compare the content or value equality of objects, and it is usually overridden in the class to provide a meaningful comparison.

Example:

```java
public class EqualsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str1 = new String("Hello");
        String str2 = new String("Hello");

        // Using == to compare references
        System.out.println(str1 == str2);          // Output: false

        // Using .equals() to compare content
        System.out.println(str1.equals(str2));     // Output: true
    }
}
```

### 24. Copy Elements of an Array into Another Array in Reverse Order:

```java
public class ReverseArrayCopy {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] originalArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] reversedArray = new int[originalArray.length];

        // Copying elements in reverse order
        for (int i = 0; i < originalArray.length; i++) {
            reversedArray[i] = originalArray[originalArray.length - 1 - i];
        }

        // Displaying the original and reversed arrays
        System.out.println("Original Array: " + Arrays.toString(originalArray));
        System.out.println("Reversed Array: " + Arrays.toString(reversedArray));
    }
}
```

### 25. Check Array Elements Condition:

```java
public class ArrayElementCheck {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1};

        // Check if the elements satisfy the given condition
        boolean conditionSatisfied = true;
        int n = arr.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            if (arr[i] != arr[n - 1 - i]) {
                conditionSatisfied = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        // Display the result
        if (conditionSatisfied) {
            System.out.println("The elements satisfy the given condition.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The elements do not satisfy the given condition.");
        }
    }
}
```

### 26. Add Two Matrices:

```java
public class MatrixAddition {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] matrix1 = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
        int[][] matrix2 = {{9, 8, 7}, {6, 5, 4}, {3, 2, 1}};
        int[][] result = new int[3][3];

        // Adding matrices
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                result[i][j] = matrix1[i][j] + matrix2[i][j];
            }
        }

        // Displaying the result
        System.out.println("Matrix 1:");
        displayMatrix(matrix1);

        System.out.println("Matrix 2:");
        displayMatrix(matrix2);

        System.out.println("Sum of Matrices:");
        displayMatrix(result);
    }

    // Helper method to display a matrix
    private static void displayMatrix(int[][] matrix) {
        for (int[] row : matrix) {
            for (int element : row) {
                System.out.print(element + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

### 27. Find Octal Equivalent:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class OctalConverter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
        int decimalNumber = scanner.nextInt();

        // Convert to octal
        String octalEquivalent = Integer.toOctalString(decimalNumber);

        // Display the result
        System.out.println("Octal Equivalent: " + octalEquivalent);
    }
}
```

### 28. Generate Combinations:

```java
public class CombinationGenerator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] elements = {1, 2, 3};

        // Generate all combinations
        for (int i : elements) {
            for (int j : elements) {
                for (int k : elements) {
                    System.out.println(i + " " + j + " " + k);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 29. Private Constructor:

Yes, a constructor can be private. A private constructor is often used in classes where instances should not be created directly, and the class provides static methods for object creation or follows a singleton pattern.

### 30. Copy Constructor:

A copy constructor is a constructor that takes an object of the same class as a parameter and creates a new object with the same state as the parameter. It is used to create a new object by copying the values of another object.

Example:

```java
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Copy constructor
    public Student(Student original) {
        this.name = original.name;
        this.age = original.age;
    }

    // Constructor
    public Student(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Getter methods
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object
        Student student1 = new Student("Alice", 20);

        // Using the copy constructor
        Student student2 = new Student(student1);

        // Displaying the information
        System.out.println("Student 1: " + student1.getName() + ", " + student1.getAge() + " years old");
        System.out.println("Student 2 (copy): " + student2.getName() + ", " + student2.getAge() + " years old");
    }
}
```

### 34. Java Program to Count Positive, Negative, and Zeros:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CountNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int positiveCount = 0;
        int negativeCount = 0;
        int zeroCount = 0;

        char choice;

        do {
            System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
            int number = scanner.nextInt();

            // Counting positive, negative, and zeros
            if (number > 0) {
                positiveCount++;
            } else if (number < 0) {
                negativeCount++;
            } else {
                zeroCount++;
            }

            System.out.print("Do you want to enter more numbers? (y/n): ");
            choice = scanner.next().charAt(0);
        } while (choice == 'y' || choice == 'Y');

        // Displaying the counts
        System.out.println("Positive Count: " + positiveCount);
        System.out.println("Negative Count: " + negativeCount);
        System.out.println("Zero Count: " + zeroCount);
    }
}
```

### 35. Anonymous Inner Classes:

Anonymous inner classes in Java are classes without a name. They are declared and instantiated at the same time. Anonymous inner classes are useful when you need to override a method of a class or implement an interface for a short duration.

### 36. Difference between String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder:

- **String:**
  - Immutable (cannot be changed once created).
  - Thread-safe.
  - Slower for concatenation operations.

- **StringBuffer:**
  - Mutable (can be changed).
  - Thread-safe.
  - Synchronized, which can lead to performance overhead.

- **StringBuilder:**
  - Mutable (can be changed).
  - Not thread-safe.
  - More efficient than StringBuffer, especially in single-threaded environments.

### 37. Adapter Class vs. Listener Interface:

- **Adapter Class:**
  - A class that provides an empty implementation of an interface so that a subclass can override only the methods it needs.
  - Reduces the effort required to implement an interface.
  - Examples: `WindowAdapter`, `MouseAdapter`.

- **Listener Interface:**
  - An interface that contains a set of abstract methods to be implemented by a class that wants to be notified of events.
  - Requires the implementation of all methods, even if not needed.
  - Examples: `ActionListener`, `MouseListener`.

**Justification:**
- Use Adapter Class when you want to provide a default implementation for all methods in an interface.
- Use Listener Interface when you want the implementing class to explicitly implement all methods of the interface.

### 38. Use of `super` and `final` keywords with `super()` method:

- **`super`:**
  - Used to refer to the superclass or parent class.
  - Used to call the constructor, methods, or fields of the superclass.
  
- **`final`:**
  - Used to make a variable, method, or class constant and unchangeable.
  - If used with a class, the class cannot be extended.
  - If used with a method, the method cannot be overridden.

Example:
```java
class Parent {
    final int MAX_VALUE = 100;

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent class method");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void display() {
        super.display();
        System.out.println("Child class method");
    }
}

public class SuperFinalExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child child = new Child();
        child.display();
        System.out.println("Max Value: " + child.MAX_VALUE);
    }
}
```

### 39. Java Program to Find the Smallest Number in an Array of 25 Integers:

```java
public class SmallestNumber {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {23, 56, 12, 78, 45, 9, 67, 34, 21, 98, 5, 76, 41, 90, 27, 63, 8, 54, 32, 88, 14, 70, 3, 60, 18};

        int smallest = numbers[0];

        // Finding the smallest number
        for (int number : numbers) {
            if (number < smallest) {
                smallest = number;
            }
        }

        // Displaying the smallest number
        System.out.println("The smallest number is: " + smallest);
    }
}
```

This program finds and displays the smallest number among the given array of integers.

### 40. Applet Life Cycle:

The life cycle of an applet in Java involves the following methods:

- **`init()`:** Initializes the applet and is called once when the applet is loaded.
- **`start()`:** Invoked after `init()` and each time the applet is started.
- **`stop()`:** Invoked when the applet is stopped, such as when the user navigates away from the page.
- **`destroy()`:** Called when the applet is about to be unloaded.

### 41. Java Supports Multiple Inheritance - Justification:

Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces. A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing it to inherit abstract methods from all the interfaces. However, a class can extend only one superclass to avoid the complexities associated with multiple inheritance.

### 42. Multi-Thread with Examples:

Multi-threading in Java allows concurrent execution of two or more threads. Example:

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getId() + " Value " + i);
        }
    }
}

public class MultiThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();

        MyThread t2 = new MyThread();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

### 43. User-Defined Exception in Java:

A user-defined exception in Java is a class that extends the `Exception` class or its subclasses. It allows developers to create their own exception classes to handle specific types of errors.

```java
class MyException extends Exception {
    public MyException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

public class UserDefinedExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            throw new MyException("This is a user-defined exception");
        } catch (MyException e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### 44. Method Overloading vs. Overriding:

- **Method Overloading:**
  - Multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters.
  - Compile-time polymorphism.
  - Example:
    ```java
   

 void display(int x) { }
    void display(double x) { }
    ```

- **Method Overriding:**
  - A method in a subclass that has the same signature (name, return type, and parameters) as a method in the superclass.
  - Runtime polymorphism.
  - Example:
    ```java
    class Animal {
        void makeSound() { }
    }

    class Dog extends Animal {
        void makeSound() { }
    }
    ```

### 45. Wrapper Class in Java:

Wrapper classes in Java are used to convert primitive data types into objects. The main wrapper classes are `Integer`, `Double`, `Boolean`, etc. They provide utility methods and can be used in collections that store objects.

Example:
```java
Integer num = new Integer(5); // Creating a wrapper object
int value = num.intValue();   // Converting wrapper object to primitive
```

### 46. Characteristics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
- **Inheritance:** The ability of a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
- **Polymorphism:** The ability of a class to take on multiple forms through method overloading and overriding.
- **Abstraction:** Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the real-world entities.

### 47. Difference between `throw` and `throws` Keywords:

- **`throw`:**
  - Used to explicitly throw an exception.
  - Used within a method to indicate that an exceptional event has occurred.

- **`throws`:**
  - Used in the method signature to declare the exceptions that the method might throw.
  - Used to delegate the responsibility of handling exceptions to the caller.

### 48. Thread vs. Process:

- **Thread:**
  - Lightweight, smaller unit of a process.
  - Shares the same memory space with other threads in the same process.
  - Efficient for communication between threads.

- **Process:**
  - Independent program, with its own memory space.
  - Heavier in terms of resource consumption.
  - Inter-process communication is more complex.

### 49. Command Line Argument Example:

```java
public class CommandLineArguments {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Displaying command line arguments
        for (String arg : args) {
            System.out.println("Argument: " + arg);
        }
    }
}
```

Run the program from the command line with arguments: `java CommandLineArguments arg1 arg2 arg3`

### 50. String Methods:

- **`toLowerCase()`:** Converts all characters in a string to lowercase.
- **`toString()`:** Returns the string representation of an object.
- **`toUpperCase()`:** Converts all characters in a string to uppercase.
- **`trim()`:** Removes leading and trailing whitespaces.
- **`valueOf()`:** Converts different types to a string.

### 51. Java Thread Lifecycle:

- **New:** The thread is in this state before the `start()` method is called.
- **Runnable:** The thread is ready to run and waiting for the scheduler to pick it.
- **Blocked:** The thread is blocked and waiting for a monitor lock.
- **Waiting:** The thread is waiting for another thread to perform a particular action.
- **Timed Waiting:** Similar to waiting, but with a specified waiting time.
- **Terminated:** The thread has exited.

These states represent the life cycle of a thread in Java.
